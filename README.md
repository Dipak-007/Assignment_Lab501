This C++ program is designed to perform various **tree traversals** on binary trees. It includes the following traversal methods:

- Inorder Traversal
- Preorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal
- Level Order Traversal
- Zigzag Level Order Traversal
- Boundary Traversal
- Diagonal Traversal
- Vertical Traversal

## Introduction

This program provides a set of functions to traverse binary trees in different orders. Tree traversals are essential operations in tree data structures, and this program allows you to explore the different ways of visiting nodes within a binary tree.

## Features

- Perform various tree traversals, including the following:

### Inorder Traversal

In an inorder traversal, the nodes of the binary tree are visited in the order: left, root, right. This traversal is commonly used for binary search trees to retrieve elements in sorted order.

### Preorder Traversal

Preorder traversal visits the root node first, followed by the left and right subtrees. It can be useful for creating a copy of the tree.

### Postorder Traversal

Postorder traversal visits the left and right subtrees before the root node. It's often used for tasks like deleting the entire tree.

### Level Order Traversal

Level order traversal visits the nodes level by level, starting from the root. This traversal provides a top-down view of the tree.

### Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Zigzag level order traversal alternates the direction of traversal at each level. It can be helpful for problems involving alternating directions in a tree.

### Boundary Traversal

Boundary traversal involves visiting the boundary nodes of a binary tree. It includes the left boundary, the leaf nodes, and the right boundary. This traversal is used to identify the outer boundary of the tree.

### Diagonal Traversal

Diagonal traversal visits nodes in diagonal fashion. It starts from the leftmost node and proceeds to the right in a downward direction. This traversal is often used in problems related to diagonal paths in a binary tree.

### Vertical Traversal

Vertical traversal explores nodes of the tree vertically. Nodes at the same horizontal distance from the root are visited together. This traversal is useful for problems involving vertical ordering of nodes.
